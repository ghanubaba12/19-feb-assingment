    "Q1. What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?\n",
    "ans-Flask is a popular Python web framework that allows developers to build web applications quickly and easily. It is a micro-framework, which means it provides only the essential features needed to build a web application. Flask is lightweight, flexible, and easy to use, making it a popular choice for small to medium-sized web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the advantages of Flask framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightweight: Flask is a lightweight framework and provides only the essential features needed to build a web application. It does not come with built-in functionality for databases, form validation, or other features that are not essential for all applications. This makes Flask easy to use and highly customizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: Flask is highly flexible and allows developers to choose the tools and libraries that they want to use. Flask is compatible with a wide range of third-party libraries and tools, making it easy to integrate with other technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy to learn: Flask is a simple framework and has a relatively small learning curve. It has a clear and concise API, making it easy for developers to understand and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: Flask is highly scalable and can handle large volumes of traffic without any issues. It can be used to build small and simple applications as well as large and complex applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing: Flask has built-in support for testing, which makes it easy for developers to test their applications. Flask provides a testing client that can be used to simulate requests and test the application's responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation: Flask has excellent documentation, which makes it easy for developers to learn and use. The documentation includes examples and tutorials, making it easy for developers to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Flask is a lightweight and flexible framework that is easy to learn and use. It is highly customizable, scalable, and has built-in support for testing. Flask's excellent documentation and compatibility with third-party tools and libraries make it a popular choice for web application development.\n",

    "In Flask, app routing refers to the process of mapping URLs to specific functions or views in your application. This is done using the @app.route decorator, which is used to bind a URL to a specific function that will be executed when that URL is accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",

    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run()\n",

The first route is mapped to the index function, which returns the message \"Welcome to my website!\" when the root URL is accessed (i.e., http://localhost:5000/). The second route is mapped to the about function, which returns the message \"This is my about page.\" when the URL http://localhost:5000/about is accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "App routing is a crucial part of any Flask application as it enables you to create different URLs that point to different views in your application. This helps to organize your code and make it more modular. By using app routing, you can create a clear and understandable URL structure for your application that makes it easy for users to navigate.\n",
